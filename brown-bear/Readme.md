## IT Interest

My father is a semiconductor developer. So since I was a child, I naturally was interested in science and IT. I have liked Steve Jobs since I was a elementary school student. I wanted to be a electronic engineer when I was young, but after talking about my future career with my father for a longtime, I decided to become a safety engineer. He and I talked a lot about current variety of industries and we agreed that safety is important and pormising.
My major in Korea is Safety engineerig.  I have common knowledge about IT fields.
